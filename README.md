Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm @Ssslakter, this is my nickname in a world wide web.

If you're interested in working together on generative AI research, feel free to connect with me via [Telegram](https://t.me/ssslakter) or check out my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ssslakter) for collaboration opportunities.

Currently navigating university life, I have a keen interest in AI, particularly generative models, especially diffusion-based. Open to collaborating on any AI projects, so if you have ideas, let's discuss!ðŸš€
